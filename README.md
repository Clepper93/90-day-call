# 90-day-call
Which accounts should be called?

If you have a company that sells software to businesses, it's a good idea to check in with your customers a few months before their sofware needs to be renewed, to make sure all is well. If you have a lot of customers, it may be difficult to determine at a glance who to call. With this program, all customers have their software renewal dates analyzed, and any that have their software up for renewal in exactly 90 days from today's date have their company name printed out, along with the sales representative assigned to manage that customer's account. 

The sample text document only includes a handful of accounts; the day I created the program, it would print out one, but odds are, if you try the program none of the dates will be 90 days from the date you're testing it on. If you want to test it, I recommend editing one of the accounts to have a day 90 days from the day you're testing on, and then give it a try. :)
